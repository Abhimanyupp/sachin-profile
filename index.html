            <h2>Sachin Tendulkar</h2>
            <b>
                <p>Sachin Tendulkar is one of the most popular cricketers not just in India but across the globe.
                    Nicknamed 'The Little Master' or 'Master Blaster', Tendulkar made his India at a young age of 16 and
                    is credited for many records across all formats of the game.</p><br>
                <p> He is the only player to have scored one hundred international tons, first batsman to score a double
                    century in an ODI, the holder of the record for the number of runs in both ODI and Test cricket,
                    and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.</p><br>
                <p>Sachin has been lauded with Arjuna Award in 1994, Khel Ratna in 1997, Padma Shri in 1998 and Padma
                    Vibhushan (2008) honours.</p><br>
                <p>He is the only sportsperson to be conferred the Bharat Ratna in 2013.</p><br>
                <p> Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2012 at his home ground of Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Since retirement,
                    he's had his autobiography published called 'Playing it My Way' and been part of numerous
                    philanthropic efforts.</p><br>
                <p>On 18 September 2011, Tendulkar spent nine hours on the 12-hour "Coca-Cola-NDTV Support My School"
                    telethon.</p><br>
                <p> The campaign raised ₹70 million (equivalent to ₹120 million or US$1.5 million in 2020) for "the
                    creation of basic facilities, particularly toilets for girl students, in 140 government schools
                    across the country".[459] In 2009, Tendulkar announced that he would sponsor the education of 200
                    children through Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based non-governmental organization associated with his
                    mother-in-law, Annabel Mehta.[460][461] As of 2013, Tendulkar continued to annually support 200
                    children through Apnalaya.[462][463]</p>

                find shortcuts to them.’ In his career spanning 24 years, hardly any records have escaped Sachin
                Tendulkar’s masterly touch.</p>
